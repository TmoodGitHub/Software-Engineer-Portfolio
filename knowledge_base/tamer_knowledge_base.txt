About
I‚Äôve spent the last 10+ years building systems that scale, evolve, and solve real problems. From startups to established tech teams, I‚Äôve worked across industries (education, cybersecurity, fintech) helping companies turn complex technical challenges into streamlined, performant solutions. What started as a curiosity for how things work became a career focused on crafting full-stack architectures, automating workflows, and designing software that‚Äôs not just functional, but dependable, efficient, and built to last.

Along the way, I‚Äôve contributed to migrations from monoliths to microservices, improved deployment pipelines, and mentored developers toward stronger, cleaner code. I‚Äôm at home working across the stack, whether building frontend interfaces that enhance user experience or shaping backend systems that drive business-critical operations. I care deeply about performance, collaboration, and writing code that teams can trust and build on. Let‚Äôs connect!
